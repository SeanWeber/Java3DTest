MOST RECENT UPDATE:
-------------------

- All shapes are assigned a unique name at creation (numbered, starting with 0)
	
- Shapes can now be repositioned on the canvas by left-click dragging

- Shapes can be deleted from the canvas by clicking on the shape and hitting the delete key (whatever shape was last clicked on will be affected by the delete key-- that shape remains "selected" until a different shape is clicked on)

- The zoom slider on the GUI is now fully functional

- Temporary: A shape will grow in size by 50% (one time) if clicked on. This is just to test out the resizing ability and should not remain in the final version. There is also a bug where the shape will return to the center of the canvas when it is resized. This needs to be fixed.
